# Research & Development Log: February 2026

This log tracks the computational milestones and logic validation phases of the 3-Lock Smart Oncolytic Virus project.

## Week 1: Foundation & Safety Logic Validation

### Feb 2: Repository Architecture & Initialization
* Established dual-repository workflow for IP protection.
* Initialized "Lite" simulation framework for viral kinetics in tumor environments.

### Feb 3: Lock 1 & 2 Logic Implementation
* Developed mathematical modeling for the Hardware Lock (Protease-activation) and Software Lock (RNA Sequestration).
* Established the **Safety Clearance Threshold** at 0.1 relative concentration.

### Feb 4: Data Interpretation Framework
* Created a technical reporting structure to analyze the difference between Standard OV decay and the 3-Lock stabilized titer.
* Integrated B.Pharm clinical pharmacology principles into the clearance timelines.

### Feb 5: Stochastic Sensitivity Logic (Phase 3)
* Transitioned model from deterministic to stochastic (randomized) parameters to account for physiological noise.
* Developed the "Safety Envelope" concept to test system robustness against variable nuclease activity ($\lambda$).

### Feb 6: Documentation & Literature Mapping
* Finalized the technical documentation for the public repository.
* Conducted a high-level review of foundational concepts in KRAS-mutant adenocarcinomas and viral immune evasion.

*Next Week's Focus: Advanced Sensitivity Visualizations & OIST Researcher Outreach.*

### Feb 7: Documentation Audit & IP Hygiene
* Conducted a thorough review of public repository files to ensure maximum transparency for recruiters while maintaining strict protection of proprietary genetic sequences.
* Verified technical terminology across README and results sections to align with industry standards for oncolytic virotherapy.
* Audited the "Lite" simulation logic to ensure it accurately represents the project's mathematical foundation without disclosing confidential variables.
